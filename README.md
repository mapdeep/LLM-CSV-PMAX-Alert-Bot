# PMAX Alert Bot

On-prem Chatbot for the Dell EMC PowerMax storage arrays!

Meet my brainchild: My on-prem chatbot, affectionately nicknamed "Atlas" by leveraging the powerful generative capabilities of Llama2-7b, a 7 billion parameter behemoth LLM model. To ensure "Atlas" truly understands what you're saying and responds with relevant content, I employed the magic of HuggingFace Embeddings by using MiniLM v2. This smaller, yet effective, language model acts as an embedding wizard, transforming human language into numerical representations that 'Atlas' can easily grasp and provides the resolution for the PowerMax storage errors and events for the Operations team or Command Center teams working 24/7 shifts.
